<h1> Who are the nearly-one-million new members of New York City’s voting population?
</h1>
<p> The New York City Council passed a sweeping voting legislation that will enfranchise over 800,000 individuals to vote in municipal elections. Here’s a breakdown of who they are and where they live. </p>

On December 9, 2021, The New York City Council approved a bill that would expand voting access to hundreds of thousands of legal residents in New York City. Also known as "Our City, Our Vote," the new legislation would allow green-card holders, DACA recipients, and individuals with work permits to vote in the City’s municipal elections for local officials, such as City Council Members, Mayor, Public Advocate, Borough Presidents, and Comptroller, as well as ballot initiatives. Though the legality of this initiative was contested by Mayor Bill de Blassio and the organization "Americans for Citizen Voting," there’s a history of non-citizens voting in municipal elections, specifically School Boards elections, before these were abolished in the early 2000s. States such as Maryland, Vermont, and California have several measures in place that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections.

NYC Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez and the bill’s primary sponsor has noted that “for too long, Green Card holders and New Yorkers with working permits have been unable to elect their local representatives. New York City has the opportunity to show the nation that we value the contributions and the hard work immigrants bring to our City.” </p>

</script>

<p> According to the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, New York City is home to 3 million immigrants, which comprise 36% of the city’s population and 43% of its workforce. In addition, non-citizens contribute around $3 billion in taxes each year. New York City’s foreign born population mostly hails from the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Mexico, and Guyana. Queens is home to the largest immigrant population in the City (35.9% of its population is foreign born), followed by Brooklyn (30.1%), Bronx (15.9%), Manhattan (14.5%), and Staten Island with the lowest percentage of foreign born residents at 3.6%. </p>

<p> Eligible non-citizens would be able to start registering to vote on December 9, 2022, and once registered, could begin voting in local elections as of January 9, 2023. According to the City Council Website, the bill will create an advisory group to provide recommendations regarding the implementation of the new municipal voting system. If the bill is enacted and doesn’t face additional legal hurdles, New York City will become the largest city in the country to allow non-citizen voting. </p>




<p> A note on the data: Calculating the exact number of the newly eligible-to-vote foreign born population is tricky. According to city data, 9.9% of the foreign born population are green card holders or have other legal status and 5.4% are undocumented immigrants. However, these percentages are estimates. The American Community Survey, the largest household survey in the U.S., does not collect data on the legal status of noncitizens. As a result, it is impossible to know exactly how many individuals will become eligible to vote. There are also around 295,700 children living in mixed-status households included in the data, many of which are U.S. citizens, that will eventually become eligible to vote. The Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity has created an experimental methodology to assign legal status to noncitizens in the ACS, whereby legal status was inferred based on responses in an augmented ACS data file that NYC Opportunity has created to produce the City’s alternative poverty model. </p>
